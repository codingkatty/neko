# Neko: Japanese notes because I need
put a banner here :3

So its almost Japanese exam, and I feel kinda cooked ngl. I just started learning like 10 months ago but I still can't... Japanese. Well, so I guess why not create a note website?

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this awesome learning page! It is very easy to do so.

### What you'll need
To contribute, you simply need to prepare a topic, a PDF is applicable and just duplicate the existing notes and start editing! The notes are pre styled, but feel free to add your own touch of flavour! For scripts, feel free to add interactive elements too, they are pretty cool.

```
notes/
  ├── yournote.html
pdf/
  └── yournote.pdf
```

Then, edit the links at `line idkdothestufffirst`.
